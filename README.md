Kobe Karate
Overview
Kobe Karate is a simplified 2D fighting game designed to teach fundamental fighting game mechanics such as neutral play, spacing, and strategic decision-making. It uses the Godot Engine to deliver a streamlined yet strategically rich experience, making the genre more accessible to newcomers while retaining depth for veterans.

Introduction
Kobe Karate aims to distill the essence of fighting games into a simple yet engaging 2D platform. Inspired by the minimalist design of games like "FOOTSIES," this project focuses on the core mechanics that define competitive fighting games.

Problem Statement
Fighting games often have a steep learning curve due to their complex mechanics. This project addresses this issue by simplifying gameplay while emphasizing essential skills like spacing, hit confirms, and whiff punishing. The goal is to create an educational tool that is both accessible to newcomers and strategically deep for experienced players.

Game Design Philosophy
The game was initially designed as a 3D fighting game but transitioned to a 2D format to streamline development and enhance accessibility. Despite this change, the focus remains on teaching the principles of neutral play, strategic movement, and tactical decision-making.

Key Mechanics
Simplified Attacks: Ground-based, high-risk, high-reward attacks encourage thoughtful play.
Strategic Movement: Emphasis on positioning and timing rather than complex combos.
One-Hit Win: A single successful hit determines the match, highlighting the importance of precision and strategy.
Character State Machine
The character state machine in Kobe Karate manages the various states of a character during gameplay, ensuring smooth transitions and appropriate responses to player inputs and game events.

State Management
State Transitions: Handle the logic for entering and exiting states based on player actions and game conditions.
Physics and Animation: Integrates with Godot's physics and animation systems to ensure responsive and fluid gameplay.
Gameplay Mechanics
Kobe Karate simplifies traditional fighting game mechanics to focus on strategic depth. Key features include:

Stubby Attacks: Limited range attacks that require careful timing and positioning.
Feints and Punishments: Use feints to bait opponents and punish missed attacks aggressively.
Movement and Spacing: Mastering movement and spacing is crucial for gaining the upper hand.
Technical Details
Engine: Developed using the Godot Engine for its versatility and robust networking capabilities.
Rollback Netcode: Potential integration to ensure smooth online play, minimizing latency and ensuring fair competition.
Advanced Features
Though not fully implemented, the game envisions adding advanced mechanics such as:

Shield and Parry Systems: Introduce defensive options to deepen strategic play.
Energy Mechanic: Manage resources like jumps to add another layer of strategy.
Contributions
Kobe Karate is a testament to the evolving nature of the fighting game community, aiming to democratize the genre by making its strategic depth accessible to a wider audience.
